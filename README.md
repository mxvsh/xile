**xile** is an open-source, self-hosted cloud file manager designed to unify file storage across multiple cloud providers into one seamless interface. Built with privacy, flexibility, and simplicity in mind, xile empowers users to manage files across different platforms without relying on centralized services.

### What is xile?

xile enables you to connect multiple cloud storage providers (Google Drive, Dropbox, S3, WebDAV, and more) into a unified interface. It acts as a **middleware layer** between your cloud services, providing a consistent file management experience with features like file previews, bulk actions, folder management, and encrypted file uploads.

- **Multi-Cloud**: Manage files across different providers from a single interface.
- **Privacy by Design**: Optional client-side encryption to protect sensitive data.
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface with dark mode support.
- **Open Source**: Community-driven and transparent.
